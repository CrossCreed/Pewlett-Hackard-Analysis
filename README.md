# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Pewlett Hackard Analysis with SQL:

### Purpose
___
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
  
The data for the project is taken from the multiple cvs files in the **Data** folder provided throughout **Module 7**.

### Pewlett Hackard Analysis Results
___
The following is a list of four major points from the two analysis deliverables: [retiring_titles.csv](https://github.com/CrossCreed/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Data/retiring_titles.csv) and [mentorship_eligibility.csv](https://github.com/CrossCreed/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Data/mentorship_eligibility.csv)

* 1. Senior Engineers and Senior Staff **each** make up roughly one-third (1/3) of eligible retirees at the company. (Total ~2/3)

* 2. As a direct result from point number 1, Senior Engineers & Staff positions should be the ones for the company to look at to fill first.

* 3. 1,549 employees qualify for the mentorship program.

* 4. Due to more individuals retiring than potential mentors available, an efficient program with adequate incentives will be required to make sure potential new hires receive the appropriate training/mentorship necessary.
